# ArenaLive-Legion
ArenaLive for Legion 7.1.x that I found on an old drive (did this in 2016)


No guarantee that this will work (on later patches) but you may be able to get it working on a Legion client or generally use to create your own port.
I just didn't want this old files I used during Legion to go to waste.
